(ns specialized.notify
  "Mail + phone transport for the SAFETY-CONCERN NOTICE this actor sends
  once a human has approved committing a `:flag-safety-concern` proposal
  -- the concrete 呼びかけ／共有 (outreach/sharing) deliverable, the
  specialized-construction-domain analog of `installation.notify`/
  `finishing.notify`.

  `Notifier` is the injection seam: `mock-notifier` (deterministic, no
  network -- the default everywhere, same as every sibling actor's mock
  advisor) for dev/tests/demo, `fn-notifier` for a real transport.
  `dispatch-safety-concern-notice!` fans the SAME notice out to every
  contact in a site's `:safety-contacts` roster (the site supervisor /
  safety officer, NOT the trade crew directly -- this actor coordinates,
  it does not dispatch a crew) over BOTH channels, isolating one
  contact's send failure from every other contact's.

  UNLIKE `construction.notify`'s auto-committed dispatch, this is NEVER
  fired by an auto-commit -- `:flag-safety-concern` always escalates to a
  human first (see `specialized.phase`/`specialized.governor` ns
  docstrings), so by the time `specialized.operation`'s `:commit` node
  calls this, a human has already reviewed the concern. This namespace
  builds/sends the message; it does NOT decide whether to send one.

  ## Portability -- fully `.cljc`, NO platform interop in this namespace

  Per this repo's mandate (cljs-first / no JVM interop -- see
  superproject CLAUDE.md `.cljc`/`.kotoba` runtime priority note), this
  namespace does NOT embed a `java.net.http` (or any other platform)
  HTTP client. The real transport (Resend/Twilio/etc.) is a plain-function
  INJECTION seam (`fn-notifier`) supplied by the HOST application -- this
  keeps `specialized.notify` itself runnable unmodified on JVM Clojure,
  ClojureScript, `nbb`, and `kotoba wasm`/`clojurewasm` alike; only the
  caller-supplied `:send-mail-fn`/`:send-phone-fn` need be
  platform-specific, and that code lives OUTSIDE this repo."
