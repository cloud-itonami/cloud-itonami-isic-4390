  "OperationActor -- one specialized-construction-project coordination
  operation = one supervised actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj
  StateGraph. The advisor (Specialized Trade Advisor) is sealed into a
  single node (:advise); its proposal is ALWAYS routed through the
  Specialized Trade Governor (:govern) and the rollout phase gate
  (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today; Datomic/kotoba-server is the next seam) - `store` arg
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)                                       - :advisor opt
    - the Notifier (mock | real, caller-injected transport)                - :notifier opt
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)                                          - :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one specialized-construction-coordination operation
  (intake -> advise -> govern -> decide -> commit | hold | approval). No
  unbounded inner loop -- each operation is auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human operator (the site supervisor). The approver
  resumes with `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or :rejected).
  `:flag-safety-concern` AND `:schedule-specialized-operation` BOTH
  ALWAYS reach this node -- see `specialized.phase`/`specialized.
  governor` ns docstrings. `:log-site-record` and `:order-supplies`
  (below the cost threshold) MAY auto-commit at phase 3 when the governor
  is clean -- see `specialized.phase` ns docstring.

  Every committed record carries `:effect :propose` (see `specialized.
  governor` ns docstring) -- the `:commit` node writes a COORDINATION
  ARTIFACT to the SSoT + audit ledger, NEVER a real-world actuation. ONLY
  when the committed op is `:flag-safety-concern` does `:commit`
  ADDITIONALLY send the safety-concern notice (mail + phone,
  `specialized.notify`) to the site's `:safety-contacts` roster --
  always AFTER a human has approved it, since `:flag-safety-concern` is
  never auto-eligible at any phase."
