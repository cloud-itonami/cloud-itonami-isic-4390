  / supply-order-proposal record construction -- an append-only
  specialized-construction-project book-of-record draft, the
  specialized-trade-domain analog of `installation.registry`/`finishing.
  registry`.

  Like every sibling actor's registry, there is no single international
  check-digit standard for any of these reference numbers -- every
  operator/jurisdiction assigns its own reference format. This namespace
  does NOT invent one; it builds a jurisdiction-scoped sequence number and
  validates the record's required fields, the same honest, non-
  fabricating discipline `specialized.facts` uses.

  `render-safety-concern-notice` produces the actual human-readable
  document text sent to a site's supervisor/safety-officer contact roster
  (`specialized.notify`) -- citing the jurisdiction's scaffold-inspection
  legal basis inline so the notice is self-evidencing about which
  regulation grounds the concern.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network call
  to any real regulatory filing system, no mail/phone send. It builds the
  RECORD/DOCUMENT this actor's `:effect :propose`-only proposals produce;
  it never builds, and this actor never proposes, a record that commands
  trade equipment or finalizes a structural-completion sign-off (see
  `specialized.governor` ns docstring)."
